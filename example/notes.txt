* Here are the trace statistics (#nan, #inf) - already reported but report as part of NEW output in Odyssey
    -> This is covered by the GPU-FPX Detector Report

* Here is the additional flow info (#inf came in the input data itself - likewise  #nan)
    ->GPU-FPX unable to do this, so ignore for now

* Here is how the incoming inf/nan in an instruction FLOWED to another instruction
    ->Covered by the analyzer_result_parser.py script

* Here is the length of each flow
    ->GPU-FPX unable to do this, so ignore for now

* Here are the kernels in which the flow occurred
    ->We have control over the kernel, so ignore for now

* Here are the GPU-FPX settings under  which the above data is reported by detector / analyzer
    ->Do later as the tool develops



add this to output also if there is an issue: cuobjdump --dump-sass <filename> (for example if it compiled to 00, use that)
