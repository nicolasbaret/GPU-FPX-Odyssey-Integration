* Here are the trace statistics (#nan, #inf) - already reported but report as part of NEW output in Odyssey
* Here is the additional flow info (#inf came in the input data itself - likewise  #nan)
* Here is how the incoming inf/nan in an instruction FLOWED to another instruction
* Here is the length of each flow
* Here are the kernels in which the flow occurred
* Here are the GPU-FPX settings under  which the above data is reported by detector / analyzer


The only slightly non-trivial task here is the above boldfaced text
